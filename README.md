# CSS Chart.js Example
CSS (Client-Side Scripting) is a module in semester 1.2 of the Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics(CSF) course in Ngee Ann Polytechnic. The objective of this assignment is to research about one library in the JavaScript ecosystem of open-source libraries.

### Example Dashboard created using Chart.js

<div align="center">
  <img align="center" width="700" src="./Dashboard Example.png" alt="Challenge Example" />
  <h4>Dashboard</h4>
</div>

This dashboard was created using Chart.js. Chart.js is a free, popular JavaScript library designed for making interactive and visually appealing HTML-based data visualizations. It is lightweight, easy to use, and supports a wide variety of chart types. Chart.js is also highly customisable with custom plugins to create outstanding visual effects like zoom and interactions.

For this assignment, I explored Chart.js to create an interactive dashboard visualizing data from [this Food Delivery Timing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/darrylljk/food-delivery-timing-is-everything). 

### Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information about food delivery performance in New Delhi, India, including: 
- Order and delivery data: Dates and times of orders and deliveries
- Payment methods: Preferred payment modes of customers (cash on delivery, digital wallets, credit card)
- Order values: Value of each order 
- Metrics such as commission fees and discounts offered (if any)

The above dashboard visualizes some key insights from this dataset to provide a better understanding of delivery performance trends in New Delhi, India.

### Features of the Dashboard
1. Pie Chart
- Visualizes the distribution of payment methods used by customers for food delivery orders
- Highlights customer preferences for payment methods

2. Stacked Line Chart
- Presents daily trends in order values and associated commission fees
